## Google Ads Data Export Script

### Description
This script is designed to automate the process of exporting Google Ads data, specifically Responsive Search Ads (RSA) and Asset Performance, into a Google Spreadsheet. It fetches data for the past two months, providing insights into campaign names, ad group names, IDs, ad strengths, and various asset performance metrics.

### Setup and Configuration

#### Prerequisites
- Access to a Google Ads account with active campaigns.
- Basic familiarity with Google Apps Script.

#### Configuration Steps
1. **Spreadsheet Setup**: 
   - Create a new Google Spreadsheet or use an existing one.
   - Copy the Spreadsheet URL.
   
2. **Script Configuration**:
   - Paste the provided script into the script editor.
   - In the `config` object at the top of the script:
     - Set `clientCode` to add a specific name to the Google Spreadsheet.
     - Replace the `SPREADSHEET_URL` with the URL of your Google Spreadsheet.
     - Ensure `SHEET_NAME` contains the names of the sheets where you want to export the data.
     - You can add specific dates in 'fromDate' & 'toDate', and change the default NumberOfDays.

3. **Google Ads API Authorization**:
   - The first time you run the script, you will be prompted to authorize it to access your Google Ads data and Google Sheets.

### Usage
Run the `main` function within the Google Apps Script editor. The script will automatically:
- Calculate the date range for given dates or the last 90 days by default
- Set up queries to fetch data from Google Ads.
- Export the fetched data into the specified sheets in your Google Spreadsheet.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors:
